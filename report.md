# **PROJECT SUMMARY**

## System Overview
**React Email Client with Gmail Integration** is a web-based email client that transforms Gmail into a Kanban-style productivity tool:
- Gmail OAuth2 authentication with secure token handling
- Kanban board interface for email workflow management (Inbox, To Do, Done)
- AI-powered email summarization using LLM (OpenAI/Gemini)
- Snooze mechanism to temporarily hide and auto-return emails
- Fuzzy search with typo tolerance and partial matching
- Semantic search using vector embeddings for conceptual relevance
- Dynamic Kanban configuration with Gmail label mapping
- Full email actions: compose, reply, forward, delete, attachments

## Technology Stack
- **Architecture:** React SPA + Backend API (Node.js)
- **Frontend:** React, react-window (virtualization), drag-and-drop library
- **Backend:** Node.js with Express
- **Database:** PostgreSQL with pgvector for embeddings
- **Authentication:** 
    - Google OAuth2 (Authorization Code flow)  
    - Username/Password
- **AI/ML:** Gemini API for summarization and embeddings
- **Email:** 
    - Gmail REST API (Google OAuth mode)
    - IMAP (Username/Password mode)
- **Vector Search:** pgvector
- **Deployment:** Frontend (Netlify), Backend (Render) Dockerized

## Key User Flows
1. **Authentication:** Google Sign-In → Backend token exchange → Session created → Redirect to Kanban
2. **Email Sync:** Login → Fetch Gmail inbox → Display as Kanban cards → Real-time updates
3. **Kanban Workflow:** View cards → Drag to columns → Status synced → Gmail labels updated
4. **AI Summary:** Email synced → LLM summarizes → Summary displayed on card
5. **Semantic Search:** User types query → Embedding generated → Vector search → Related emails returned

## Security Considerations
- **Access Token:** Stored in-memory on frontend only
- **Refresh Token:** Stored server-side in secure datastore (never exposed to frontend)
- **OAuth Flow:** Authorization Code flow (not implicit) for security
- **Token Refresh:** Handled server-side with concurrency protection
- **Logout:** Clears all tokens and optionally revokes OAuth refresh token
